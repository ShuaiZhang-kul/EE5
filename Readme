This project is about building a website for a caring center. In the beginning of the project, it is a team project with four members. Due to the Covid-19, it was chenged into a 
personal assignment therefore it is just one part of the whole website including the main page and login page etc. Due to the separated assignments, the database is not
well-designed but only to achieve the function :)
For more explanation, you can check the report “EE5-Final paper-Shuai zhang.pdf” or there is a Video as demo
